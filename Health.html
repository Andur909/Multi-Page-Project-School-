			<h3 id="title_info">BMI Info</h3><br>
			<p id="info">Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used measure to estimate a healthy body weight
			based on an individual's height. Calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms
			by their height in meters squared, BMI categorizes weight into various ranges such as underweight,
			normal weight, overweight, and obese. While it provides a quick, easy-to-use method for assessing
			weight-related health risks, BMI does not differentiate between muscle and fat mass, and may not accurately
			reflect the health status of those with high muscle mass or certain ethnicities. Therefore, it should be
			considered as one of many tools in assessing health.</p><br>

			<h3 id="title_info">Water Calculator Information</h3><br>
			<p id="info">A Water Intake Calculator helps determine how much water you should drink each day.
			It usually considers your weight, how active you are, and the climate you live in. For example,
			a simple guideline is to drink half your body weight in ounces of water daily. So, if you weigh 150 pounds,
			aim for 75 ounces of water. This amount can change if you're very active or in a hot environment. Drinking enough
			water is essential for good health, as it helps with body temperature, joint health, and preventing infections.
			However, everyone's needs are different, and factors like exercise and weather can affect how much water you need.</p><br>
